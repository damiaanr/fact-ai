# General instructions

Please be aware that we have two different versions of the code belonging to this project:

1. The originally provided code by Plumb. et al, upgraded to TensorFlow 2.x
    1. For the (by Plumb et al.) pre-trained models that are simply _evaluated_, head to `ELDR-TF2.x_(pre_trained_models)` for further instructions
    2. For the (by us) re-trained models, using the upgraded existing code, head to `ELDR-TF2.x_(newly_trained_models)` for further instructions
2. Our new, from-scratch, implementation which includes additional dimensionality reduction algorithms and datasets - head to `ELDR-NEW`
